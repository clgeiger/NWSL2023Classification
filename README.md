# Predicting NWSL Match Outcomes  

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting match outcomes (win, loss, tie) for the 2023 National Womenâ€™s Soccer League (NWSL) season. Using statistical analysis and machine learning models, this project explores game statistics to predict match results.

## Project Overview  

- **Data Source**: Manually entered first-half game statistics for all 2023 NWSL games.  
- **Preprocessing**: Addressed missing data, class imbalance, and feature selection.  
- **Feature Selection**: Techniques such as Mutual Information Scores, F-statistics, and Random Forest Importance were used to identify the most predictive features.  
- **Models Used**: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models were developed and optimized for two versions:  
  1. **Win/Loss/Tie Classification**: Predicts all three possible outcomes for a game.  
  2. **Win/Not Win Classification**: Combines losses and ties into a single category, focusing on whether a team wins or does not win.  

- **Neural Network Models**: Initially explored, but ultimately excluded due to significant issues with overfitting and an inability to predict ties accurately.

## Highlights  

- **Manual Data Entry**: Addressed challenges with data accuracy, opting to focus on the 2023 season after initial plans to incorporate multiple seasons.  
- **Feature Selection**: Leveraged various techniques and standardization to determine key predictors.  
- **Model Optimization**: Employed tools like GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.  
- **Dual Models**: Developed separate models to handle both granular (win/loss/tie) and broader (win/not win) classification tasks.  
- **Neural Networks**: Despite attempts to improve performance, neural network models were abandoned due to persistent overfitting and their inability to predict ties accurately.

## Results  

- **Top Performers**: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree models demonstrated effective performance in both classification versions.  
- **Challenges**: Neural networks struggled with tie prediction and overfitting, leading to their exclusion from the final models.

## Future Work  

- Incorporate data from multiple seasons to generalize results.  
- Explore team-specific variables to create tailored models.  
- Experiment with advanced machine learning techniques and additional datasets.
